# chatter
This is a Peer-to-Peer chat example in C# using TCP/IP sockets.  Just for fun.

# Peer-to-peer architecture
P2P architecture is a commonly used computer networking architecture in which each workstation, or node, has the same capabilities and responsibilities. It is often compared and contrasted to the classic client/server architecture, in which some computers are dedicated to serving others.  Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.

# What is peer to peer network?
When several computers are interconnected, but no computer occupies a privileged position, the network is usually referred to as a peer-to-peer network. In this type of network, every computer can communicate with all the other machines on the network, but in general each one stores its own files and runs its own applications. With a client-server network, one or more servers will perform critical functions on behalf of the other machines (the clients) on the network. These functions might include user authentication, data storage, and the running of large, shared, resource-intensive applications such as databases and client relationship management (CRM) software. Typically, both peer-to-peer and client-server networks rely on a shared Internet connection for access to external resources of these basic network structures.

# Features:
-	Can drag and drop files into the upper RichTextBox, and will send almost any size to the connected peer.
-	Much cleaner Socket connections with Acknowledgments, and can even detect if the connected users are typing.
-	Can broadcast basic messages to all connected user(s).
- Can automatically search for other peers on the network.
-	Debug mode allows extensive testing with console like printouts.
